Fibroblasts are important for tissue repair and maintenance of immune cell niches across tissues. It remains unclear how the stromal composition of a human organ changes from health across diverse disease contexts. In this study, we integrated ~2 million human single-cell transcriptomes to construct an atlas of 357,276 skin fibroblasts, spanning health and 23 skin disorders. We define 6 major fibroblast populations in health based on gene expression and distinct anatomical niches, establishing a comprehensive spatially-informed atlas of healthy skin. We characterised a fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC)-like subtype in the perivascular niche in health and disease, which appears absent in mouse skin. We predict a likely origin of FRC-like fibroblasts from lymphoid tissue organiser (LTo)-like cells, which we uniquely identified in human prenatal skin. We identified three disease-specific fibroblast subtypes. Inflammatory myofibroblasts (IL11+MMP1+CXCL5+IL7R+) were conserved in inflammatory disorders and cancer across multiple human tissues.
