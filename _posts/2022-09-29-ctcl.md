Cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a potentially fatal clonal malignancy of T cells, primarily affecting the skin. Lack of specific tumour markers for CTCL and similarity to benign inflammatory skin diseases presents a diagnostic challenge resulting in frequently delayed diagnosis. We performed single cell transcriptome and T cell receptor profiling of CTCL skin and integrated analyses with datasets from healthy skin, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis which revealed tumour-, patient- and stage-specific gene expression signatures of malignant T cells. Malignant CTCL cells were patient-specific but a subset of these cells expressed a glycolytic gene programme across all donors. Early stage CTCL was characterised by cytotoxic and effector-like malignant T cell clones in contrast to central memory-like clones within a Th2-permissive tumour microenvironment in late CTCL. The CTCL microenvironment featured MHC-II+ fibroblast subsets reminiscent of lymphoid organ fibroblasts as well as monocyte-derived DCs promoting a Th2-biased environment and malignant T cells. Finally, we demonstrated and validated the presence of intra-tumoral B cells as a discriminatory marker for CTCL. Increased B cell accumulation in CTCL lesions form tertiary lymphoid structures associated with progressive disease and could be used as a novel histological hallmark for CTCL diagnosis and staging.
